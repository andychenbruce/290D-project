\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach to automated program correction by approximating imperative programs as neural networks. Our framework ``softens'' discrete code operations into differentiable analogs, enabling gradient-based optimization to correct parameters in the code. We build upon theoretical foundations introduced by recent work and implement an automatic differentiation framework for arbitrary imperative code. We also incorporate custom type systems to handle complex control flows, implement differentiable data structures, and utilize Markovian representations of loops. While our technique demonstrates the ability to correct simple code errors via gradient descent and related optimization methods, we note key limitations: convergence does not guarantee correctness, and non-differentiable behaviors remain challenging. Nevertheless, this work lays groundwork towards automated, data-driven program repair through neural optimization.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Debugging and correcting software errors can be both time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional automated repair tools rely on static analysis, search, or constraint solving, but often struggle when code semantics must be tuned or learned directly from data and examples. We propose an approach that treats programs as differentiable computational graphs, enabling the use of deep learning optimization techniques to correct code parameters.

This idea is motivated by the observation that if we can ``soften'' discrete operations in code (e.g., conditionals, integer operations, indexing) into differentiable approximations, then the program itself can be interpreted as a neural network. Given a set of test cases or specifications that define correctness conditions, we can backpropagate from a loss function representing deviation from correct behavior. Updates to program parameters can effectively ``correct'' logical or arithmetic errors.

We build upon theoretical insights from differentiable programming \cite{blondel2024elementsdifferentiableprogramming, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-07587, vandemeulebroucke2018myia} and related works. Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item A type system and automatic differentiation framework that transforms discrete imperative code into a differentiable analog.
    \item A ``hard interpreter'' for original code and a ``soft interpreter'' for its differentiable approximation.
    \item Techniques for softening discrete operations (e.g., booleans, integer indexing, control flow) and hardening them back after optimization.
    \item Approaches to complex features: dynamic loss function generation from test cases, handling while loops as Markov chains, differentiable dictionaries, and initial explorations of Hessian-based optimization methods.
    \item An evaluation showing the feasibility of correcting simple program errors through gradient-based updates.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Related Work}
\paragraph{Differentiable Programming.} Differentiable programming aims to integrate gradient-based optimization into the software development process, allowing parameters within code to be tuned automatically \cite{blondel2024elementsdifferentiableprogramming,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-07587,vandemeulebroucke2018myia}. Earlier works have explored differentiable interpreters and soft approximations of discrete structures, but significant challenges remain in applying these ideas to general imperative programs.

\paragraph{Automated Program Repair.} Existing automated repair techniques often rely on search strategies or constraint-based methods. These approaches lack a direct gradient signal and often struggle to handle large search spaces efficiently. Our method proposes leveraging gradient-based optimization to guide corrections, potentially converging faster in parameterized programs.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Auto-Differentiation Framework and Custom Type System}
To apply deep learning techniques, we must convert programs into a form amenable to backpropagation. We implement an auto-differentiation framework that operates on an intermediate representation of the code, modeled as a computational graph. This involves:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Custom Type System:} Variables and values in the code are assigned types that describe how they interact and can be ``softened.'' For instance, booleans become probabilities in $[0,1]$, integers become real numbers, and indexing operations become probabilistic lookups.
    \item \textbf{Soft Interpreter:} Alongside the original (hard) interpreter that executes discrete code, we define a soft interpreter that executes the softened code. Control flow, arithmetic, and data structure operations are replaced with smooth approximations.
    \item \textbf{Gradient Computation:} We manually implement both first- and second-order derivatives (gradients and Hessians) to enable backpropagation and potential use of second-order optimization methods.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Softening and Hardening Code}
The core idea is to replace discrete program constructs with differentiable counterparts:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Boolean Softening:} A boolean condition is replaced by a continuous probability (e.g., via a sigmoid function). Thus, `if (x > 2)` becomes `if (sigmoid(x - 2))`.
    \item \textbf{Integer Softening:} Integers can be represented by real numbers. For indexing, we may represent indices as Gaussian distributions over array positions, enabling differentiable approximations of discrete indexing.
\end{itemize}

After optimization converges, a ``hardening'' step maps these differentiable approximations back to discrete values. For booleans, we choose the nearest discrete value (e.g., thresholding at 0.5). For integers, we round to the nearest integer. This final hardening step returns the modified program to a standard executable form.

\subsection{Dynamic Loss Function Generation}
The loss function is derived from user-provided test cases that specify correct program behavior. Each test case provides input-output pairs, and the difference between the program's soft output and the expected output defines a loss. We aggregate losses over all test cases, and the optimization process attempts to minimize this aggregated loss.

As the model trains, continuous values that represent conditions or parameters in the code adjust to reduce loss. When the loss approaches zero, the softened approximation aligns closely with the target specification. However, due to approximation and non-smoothness, zero loss does not guarantee perfect discrete correctness.

\section{Advanced Techniques}

\subsection{Hessian Methods}
While gradient-based optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) are $O(n)$ in the number of parameters, exploring second-order methods like Newton's method can improve convergence. Computing Hessians is $O(n^2)$ and requires complicated analysis, but may speed convergence for small programs. We experimented with computing Hessians directly, though non-differentiability and scaling issues remain challenging.

\subsection{Markovian While Loops}
While loops are problematic because their iteration count is not fixed and can be infinite. We approximate while loops as Markov chains, with transition probabilities representing the likelihood of continuing the loop. By limiting the depth of unrolling or relying on probabilistic approximations, we can differentiate through loop constructs. Although infinite loops cannot be fully captured, this approach allows partial differentiability for loops.

\subsection{Differentiable Dictionaries}
Key-value lookups in dictionaries are inherently discrete. We implement dictionaries as kernel-based lookups over continuous key embeddings. Inspired by self-attention mechanisms, we represent keys as vectors and compute a weighted sum of values based on similarity. This enables differentiability in dictionary operations, albeit with increased computational overhead.

\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation}
To train and evaluate the framework, we generate synthetic data by perturbing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of correct programs. This produces incorrect variants and their corresponding test cases. This approach can generate large training sets, facilitating stable training and evaluation of the methodâ€™s ability to correct errors.

\section{Results and Discussion}
We implemented our framework and tested it on simple toy programs. For instance, consider a program that checks if a number is greater than two but is incorrectly using the threshold of four. By softening the comparison and introducing a parameter $C$, we can backpropagate from test cases (e.g., inputs around 2) to adjust $C$ towards the correct threshold.

Empirically, we observed:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Programs with simple arithmetic and conditional logic can be partially corrected by gradient-based updates.
    \item Loss convergence suggests that softened parameters often move toward correct values.
    \item More complex programs with loops, dictionaries, and intricate logic remain challenging due to non-differentiability and high computational costs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}
Several obstacles remain:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Convergence Issues:} Zero loss in the softened domain does not guarantee correctness in the hardened, discrete program.
    \item \textbf{Non-Differentiability:} Certain operations have null second derivatives or discontinuities, limiting the applicability of second-order methods.
    \item \textbf{Complex Structures:} Infinite loops, variable-length lists, and string keys are difficult to soften. Many data structures must be approximated in restrictive ways.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Gradient computations, especially Hessians, grow quickly in cost. Larger programs may be infeasible to handle with this approach.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept for automatically correcting program errors using deep learning optimization methods. By approximating programs as neural networks and defining differentiable substitutes for discrete operations, we open the door to gradient-based program repair.

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Richer Data Structures and Control Flow:} Expanding differentiability to handle more complex language features efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Leveraging GPU acceleration and more efficient differentiation frameworks to scale to larger programs.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Optimization Methods:} Improving convergence with second-order methods and more sophisticated meta-optimizers.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation:} Testing on non-trivial codebases and real-world bugs to assess practical utility.
\end{itemize}

Though many challenges remain, our approach represents a step toward integrating neural optimization into software development workflows, potentially reducing debugging effort and improving program reliability.
